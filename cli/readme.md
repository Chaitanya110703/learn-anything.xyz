# CLI

Purpose of the CLI is to allow all kinds of operations on top of Learn Anything (local and server).

## Run

```
bun cli.ts
```

## Tasks

- move ts code from electron version into this CLI
  - pre seed Nikita's wiki so we can release
    - because markdown-rs parsing is not trivial is a big blocker ðŸ˜¿
  - do it with TS and some hacks, do release and then come back to the rust version
